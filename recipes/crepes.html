    <p>A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: 
        sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées). 
        They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, 
        and a variety of spreads.[4] Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette. </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and 
            whisk vigorously until smooth. </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, 
            using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the 
            batter coats the surface evenly. </li>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side 
            has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot. </li>
    </ol>
