    <h1>French Toast</h1>
    <img src="../images/French-Toast-syrup.jpg" alt="French Toast" height="310" width="310">
    <p>French toast is a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan-fried. 
        Alternative names and variants include eggy bread,[1] Bombay toast, gypsy toast,[2] and 
        poor knights (of Windsor).[3]</p>
    <p>When French toast is served as a sweet dish, sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon are also 
        commonly added before pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), 
        butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, 
        and it can then be served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise.</p>
